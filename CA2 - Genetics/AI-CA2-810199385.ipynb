    "## Part 6: Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. How can very large or very small population sizes affect the performance of the algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "If the population size is very small, the algorithm may not be able to find the best solution because it may not have enough chromosomes to select from. On the other hand, if the population size is very large, the algorithm may take a long time to find the best solution and it may be unnecessary to spend that much time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What happens if the population size increases in each generation?\n",
    "\n",
    "This **may** result in a better solution. However, it increases the time complexity and the memory usage. Also, it is unnecessary to do this because we can remove the chromosomes with the lowest fitness from the population in order to keep the population size constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What is the effect of crossover and mutation? Is it possible to use only one of them?\n",
    "\n",
    "Crossover is used to create new chromosomes from the existing chromosomes. Mutation is used to change the genes of the chromosomes. If we use only one of them, we may not be able to find the best solution. For example, if we use only crossover, we may stop at a local maximum. If we use only mutation, we may not be able to find the best solution. It is important to note that the crossover and mutation probabilities should be chosen carefully. The crossover probability is usually at least 80% and the mutation probability is usually at most 5%.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. How to accelerate the algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "Fitness function, parameters such as the probability of crossover and mutation, and the population size should be chosen carefully. Also, the crossover and mutation functions can affect the performance of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. How to stop the algorithm if it is not converging?\n",
    "\n",
    "A common problem in genetic algorithms is that it may stop at a local maximum instead of the global maximum. Mutation is a good way to solve this problem. Also, we can limit the number of generations in order to stop the algorithm if it is not converging. In this case, we may also use multi-start to increase the probability of finding the global maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. How to stop the algorithm if there exists no solution?\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the previous question, we can limit the number of generations in order to stop the algorithm if there exists no solution. We can use the following formula for the generation limit:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$GenLimit = 2\\times POPULATION\\_SIZE\\times equationLength$$"
